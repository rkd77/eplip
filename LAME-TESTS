These test were done on two machines that
differ as much as possible in the parformance of all subsystems
that affect the EPLIP link.
The best connection could be achieved if both machines run their ISA
at the same speed. Their CPUs are quite similar in performance and for
DMA ransfers they are equiped with the same amount of system memmory( both
have less than 16MB of RAM - or both have more than 16MB of RAM:
if they have < 16MB it is guarantied that all socket buffers either
allocated from the EPLIP driver for incoming packets or passed to EPLIP
transmit routine from the kernel are DMA safe and no COPY to the bounce buffer
will be required. In the other case both sides almost everytime will need to COPY
from/to the bounce buffer).

More equivalent the machines are , more optimal are transfers between them over EPLIP,
and vice versa.

1. Amd-K6-II-450Mhz: ISA Bus running at 8Mhz( 4Mhz on DMA cycles ),256MB RAM,UDMA 33 HDD
2. Amd486DX4-120Mhz: FSB 40Mhz-ISA Bus runs at 1/3 of the FSB( again the DMA cycles are at half clock rates ), 16MB RAM,
   Not so Slow HDD but the IDE chipset supports only PIO modes.

Test were done with a 13.5 Megs gzip compressed file. 3 meters Flat Ribbon Cable ( instead of
recomended shielded TP ) was used, but there were only 2 physical link errors as you'll
see from the ifconfig statistics.

=======================================================================
Next test were done whith eplip running in mode=0x8 ( DMA sends & receives )
They show that this mode is slower - but on the "sender" side it is much
less CPU intensive than the default PIO mode. However the receiver is
still CPU "killer" ( In the current version -0.4pre1 ).
